# auto-aiming
Revitalized auto-aiming suite for Purdue RoboMaster Club 2024-2025.

![build status](https://github.com/RoboMaster-Club/auto-aiming/actions/workflows/colcon-tests.yml/badge.svg)

## Usage  
Clone this repository into your `ros2-ws` directory. We provide a `run` script that can be used to build, run, test, and clean the workspace with no hassle. The script supports the following functionalities:

- **Building**
  - `./auto-aiming/run build`
- **Launch ROS2 code**
  - `./auto-aiming/run run <launch_file>`
  - "launch files" basically run several ROS2 nodes at once. The main one is `video2detector.py`.
- **Run automated tests (GTest)**
  - `./auto-aiming/run test`
- **Clean the workspace (remove build and install folders)**
  - `./auto-aiming/run clean`
- _Optional flags_
  - `--quiet`: Suppresses console output, logs output to `command_output.log`.
  - `--debug`: Builds with debug flags enabled. Used to display a detection results window and debug logs.

### Example to run the detector:
```
./auto-aiming/run --debug --quiet run video2detector.py
```

## Overall Suite Requirements
### Functional Requirements:
- [x] **Detect an enemy armor plate in the camera's FOV.**
  - [ ] Meet the following detection rate and accuracy requirements:
    - [ ] 5 meters: 90% detection rate, 5% pixel loss
    - [x] 3 meters: 95% detection rate, 5% pixel loss
    - [x] 2 meters: 95% detection rate, 5% pixel loss
  - [x] Reduce search area around previously detected plates ("search area reduction").
  - [x] Achieve 120 Hz detection frequency.
  - [ ] Classify the robot type based on its armor plate sticker.
- [x] **Compute camera-relative XYZ pose via PnP solving with 5% error margin.**
- [ ] **Filter out false positives and noise in the detection results.**
  - [ ] Use a Kalman filter to smooth XYZ pose estimates.
  - [x] Apply a "validity filter" for erroneous detection/pose results (e.g., based on distance, XYZ shifts). 
- [x] **Compute the gimbal angles (yaw and pitch) required to accurately land projectiles on the detected armor plate.**
  - [ ] Compute pitch using an easily-adjustable lookup table or ballistic model based on distance to target.
  - [ ] Compute yaw using a predictive model using the detected armor's XYZ pose, rotation, and velocity
- [x] **Send the computed gimbal angles to the STM32 control board via UART.**

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- [x] **Performance**  
  - Ensure real-time end-to-end performance of 120 Hz.
- [] **Testability**  
  - Include a comprehensive suite of unit tests for all modules to verify component correctness.
- [x] **Maintainability**  
  - Maintain modularity by separating ROS2 and C++ logic into `xyzNode.cpp` and `xyz.cpp` files.  
  - Provide thorough documentation, including doxygen-style comments for functions and README files for modules.
